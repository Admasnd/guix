     "Mesecons is a mod for Minetest implementing various items related
to digital circuitry, such as wires, buttons, lights and programmable
controllers.  Among other things, there are also pistons, solar panels,
pressure plates and note blocks.

Mesecons has a similar goal to Redstone in Minecraft, but works in its own way,
with different rules and mechanics.")
